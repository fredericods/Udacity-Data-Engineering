#### **Cloud Computing**
- What is?
  - Using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server of a personal computer.
- Advantages:
  - Eliminate need to invest in costly hardware upfront
  - Rapidly provision resources
  - Provide efficient global acsess

#### **Step-by-step**

1) Create an IAM Role
    - Roles > Create Roles > Redshift > Redshift - Customizable > Next: Permissions > Attach permissions policies > AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

2) Create Security Group
    - [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) > Network and Security > Security Groups >  Create Security Group > `redshift_security_group` for Security group name > "authorize redshift cluster access" for Description > Inbound tab under Security group rules
    - Add Rule: Type (Custom TCP Rule), Protocol (TCP), Port Range(5439), Source(Custom IP, 0.0.0.0/0)
    - Important: Using 0.0.0.0/0 is not recommended for anything other than demonstration purposes because it allows access from any computer on the internet. In a real environment, you would create inbound rules based on your own network settings.
    - Create

3) Launch a Redshift Cluster
    - [Amazon Redshift console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/) > Cluster > Lauch
    - Cluster identifier (redshift-cluster), Database name (dev), Database port (5439), Master username (awsuser), Master user password (Udacity123)
    - Node configuration (set default)
    - Additional Configuration: VPC security groups (redshift_security_group), Available IAM roles (myRedshiftRole)

4) Create an IAM User
    - [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) > Users > Add Users > Name airflow_redshift_user > Programmatic access > Next: Permissions > Choose "Attach existing policies directly" > Select "AmazonRedshiftFullAccess" and "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" > Next: Tags > Next: Review > Create user
    - Save your credentials

5) Delete a Redshift Cluster
    - Make sure to delete your cluster each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs. You can always launch a new cluster, so don't leave it running overnight or throughout the week if you don't need to.

6) Create a PostgreSQL DB Instance using RDS
    - [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) > Databases > Create Database > PostgreSQL > Dev/Test
