# **Data Engineering Nanodegree**
## **1. Data Modeling**
### **1.3 NoSQL Data Models**
---
#### **When Not to Use SQL**:
- Need high Availability in the data: Indicates the system is always up and there is no downtime
- Have Large Amounts of Data
- Need Linear Scalability: The need to add more nodes to the system so performance will increase linearly
- Low Latency: Shorter delay before the data is transferred once the instruction for the transfer has been received.
Need fast reads and write

#### **Apache Cassandra**
- Opensource, masterless architecture, high availabilty, linearly scalable
- Every node is connected to every node: peer to peer database architecture.
- Apache Cassandra Architecture:
  - [Understanding the architecture](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archTOC.html)
  - [Cassandra - Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cassandra/cassandra_architecture.htm)

#### **Distributed Databases**
- In a distributed databases, in order to have high availabilty, you need copies of your data.
- **Eventual Consistency**: over time (if no new changes are made) each copy of the data will be the same, but if there are new changes, the data may be different in different locations. The data may be inconsistent for only milliseconds. There are workarounds in place to prevent getting stale data.

#### **Data deployment x Data modeling**
- Deployment strategies have very little to do with data modeling. Developing deployment strategies focuses on determining how many clusters to create or determining how many nodes are needed.
- These are topics generally covered under database architecture, database deployment and operations.
- In general, the size of your data and your data model can affect your deployment strategies. You need to think about how to create a cluster, how many nodes should be in that cluster, how to do the actual installation.

#### **CAP Theorem**
- A theorem in computer science that states it is impossible for a data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:
  - **Consistency**: every read from the database gets the latest and correct piece of data or an error
  - **Availability**: every request is received and a response is given - without a guarantee that the data is the latest update
  - **Partition Tolerance**: the system continues to work regardless of losing network connectivity between nodes
- Apache Cassandra and other NoSQL Databases: AP database. But it has **eventual consistency**.

#### **Denormalization in Apache Cassandra**
- Denormalization is not just okay - it's a must
- Denormalization must be done for fast reads
- Apache Cassandra has been optimized for fast writes
- ALWAYS think Queries first
- One table per query is a great strategy
- Apache Cassandra does not allow for JOINs between tables
#### **CQL**
- Cassandra Query Language: similar to SQL, but JOINS, GROUP BY ou subqueries are not supported by SQL.

#### **Primary Key**
- The **primary key** is how each row can be uniquely identified and how the data is distributed across the nodes (or servers) in our system.
- Must be unique
- The **primary key** is made up of either just the **partition key** or may also include additional **clustering columns**
- The **partition key** will determine the distribution of data across the system
- A Simple PRIMARY KEY is just one column that is also the PARTITION KEY. A Composite PRIMARY KEY is made up of more than one column and will assist in creating a unique value and in your retrieval queries


#### **Clustering Columns**
- The clustering column will sort the data in sorted ascending order, e.g., alphabetical order.
- More than one clustering column can be added (or none!)
- From there the clustering columns will sort in order of how they were added to the primary key

#### **WHERE Clause**
- Data Modeling in Apache Cassandra is query focused, and that focus needs to be on the WHERE clause
- Failure to include a WHERE clause will result in an error
- `SELECT * FROM myTable` in Apache Cassandra is highly discouraged as performance will be slow (or may just fail) but it is possible with a configuration setting.
